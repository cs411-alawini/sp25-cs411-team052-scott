## Project Summary

Our project aims to help users find the cheapest airline flights by analyzing historical flight data
and real-time airfare data. Finding a cheap flight can be difficult, especially with so many
different airlines and pricing options. Using historical data about flight prices and airport
locations, we hope to first inform users about the best time to book flights given a specific
location for the cheapest price. Then, we will search for current flights and show the lowest
available prices. Our goal is to provide a wide variety of pricing information to inform users
about their flight choices. Users can be advised to buy tickets, or wait until a cheaper ticket
opens up based on historical prices. Users will have the option to search flights, view data, and
save flight information for future reference.
